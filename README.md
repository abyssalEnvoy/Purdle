# Purdle

A two-player competitive Wordle clone I made in a little over 24 hours for school using Python for learning purposes.

Play the game on my [itch.io](https://abyssalenvoy.itch.io/purdle) page!

## Building from source

You can get Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **and** install Pygame using ``pip install pygame``.
